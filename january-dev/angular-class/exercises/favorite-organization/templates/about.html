            Founded in 1960, the Humane Society of Utah (HSU) has always fostered an atmosphere of love, compassion and respect for Utah’s pets and is dedicated to the elimination of pain, fear and suffering in all animals. The HSU is a member of the No-Kill Utah Coalition and works hard to ensure that every healthy and treatable pet that enters our facility will be placed into a loving home. There is no set limit on the length of time an animal may remain in our adoption program.

            HSU is an open-admissions shelter, meaning that their doors are always open for any animal that they can legally accept. In 2014, an expansion and renovation project was completed which allowed the HSU to save more pets than ever before. In 2015, 11,318 pets received positive outcomes and they achieved no-kill statistics for both cats and dogs for the first time – a milestone in 55 years. Through an education-focused adoption process, positive image promotion of shelter pets, and their many other programs and services, even more animals are expected to be saved in the future.

            The Humane Society of Utah recognizes that the key to reducing the euthanasia of pets in Utah is through controlling the pet population. In 2015, over 11,143 dogs, cats and rabbits were spayed/neutered by their veterinarians – 3,564 of which were owned animals. The HSU Clinic also administered over 94,204 dog and cat vaccinations to ensure the health of both shelter animals and owned pets in the community. Over 3,064 animals at risk of euthanasia were transferred to the facility in 2015 to reduce the burden on other smaller shelters across the state of Utah and neighboring states.
